## Scripts

_**'npm run lint'**_: check for any linting errors in the codebase

_**'npm start'**_: run the server normally

_**'npm run dev'**_: run the server via nodemon which watches the src/ folder for any changes, restarting the server when a change is detected

_**'npm run debug'**_: run the server the same as dev, but also start the node inspector on port 9229 so that you can attach a debugger (in my case, VSCode's debugger)
